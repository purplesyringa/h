Thank you for deciding to contribute to `h`! We appreciate it.

There's many ways to contribute to `h`:

- Find bugs. We all know they're there. Feel free to open an issue or a PR.
- Add documentation. There's never enough of it.
- Add tests.
- Port APIs from other hash tables to `h` tables. This includes various methods on `HashSet` that we don't currently implement.
- Look for datasets for which generation hangs or takes more time than expected.
- Speed up the building process. This is difficult, but very rewarding.
- Improve `GenericHasher` performance in the generic case or for specific types, while keeping it a quality hash.
- Add `PortableHash` implementations for commonly used types.
